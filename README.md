An explanation of some Spring Boot stuff.

In the src/main/java folder live the GermainSbApplication.java file, which is the runner/main for the project. This file does not need to be changed at all. Line 10 is the code that creates the application context, which is the inversion of control container (Bean Bag). It's the place where Spring stores all of it's beans. Beans ARE the OBJECTS. So in the application we're gonna write classes. In Java, Java classes are used to make objects, except that in Spring, we don't do that. In Spring, Spring itself will scan all our classes and look for certain annotations, and those annotations will tell Spring that it's a particulary kind of bean, and Spring will make an object from that class for us so we don't do things like new animal, new customer, new car etc. Spring does it, and it makes an object and it stores it in something called the application context, which is the Bean Bag. The reason it does that is because it wants to have access to those objects all the way through the application. It scans the application for componant beans and makes beans out of the classes and stores them.
It also spins up a Web Server because the Spring Web dependancy has been added. This means it starts up the server that we need to start sending incoming requests and send back responses.
The application live in the com.rsg.germainsb package.
